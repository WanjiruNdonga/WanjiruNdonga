<h1 align="center">⚜️ Hey, I’m Mercy!</h1>

<p align="center">
My cloud, my rules, my aesthetic. Welcome to my journey. 👑☁️ <br>
I’m a Cybersecurity & Cloud girlie navigating Terraform errors one iced coffee at a time. <br>
Always building, always (intentionally... mostly 👀) breaking things, and never taking tech <em>too</em> seriously.

### 🛠️ My Cloudy Skillset:
- ☁️ AWS Certified: SAA + CCP (yes, I have the badges to prove it 💅)
- 🔐 Cybersecurity Analyst – from threat hunting to phishing analysis
- 💻 Terraforming my way through cloud automation (and manifesting zero errors👀)
- 🧪 Breaking stuff in the lab so you don’t have to (you’re welcome!)

---

### 🎤 Spill the Tea, Tech Edition:
- I learned about IAM and now I have trust issues. 😂  
  No one gets full access around here unless they really deserve it. 😤🔐✨

- Yes, I talk to my cloud resources. 🙈  
  “Please deploy this time, I beg…” – Me to Terraform, daily 🧎🏽‍♀️💻✨

---

### ✨ Currently Manifesting (because why not be iconic?):
- Making secure cloud infrastructure look *aesthetic* (if it isn’t cute, I don’t want it)
- Building a Terraform study tracker, because, darling, even complex infrastructure needs cute planning. 👑
- Landing a role where I can serve logs, lip gloss, and legendary energy—all at once 💄✨
- More iced coffee, less cloud drama (please and thank you, universe!)
